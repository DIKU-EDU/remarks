When judging student performance, it is useful to have both small, composable,
quantitive judgements, and qualitative remarks. This makes both spreadsheets
and mere text-files ill-suited for marking student work.  Although
[[http://orgmode.org/][org-mode]] can solve this problem to a great extent, it
becomes a heavy tool in the light of having to mark hundreds of students in a
distributed fashion. With org-mode, everything is in one file, while global,
intra-student statistics are not needed until all the students have been fully
marked.

* Design Goals

  1. One human-readable/editable file per student.
  2. Export options to spreadsheet-formats.
  3. git-friendly file format.
  4. Synchronization options with Dropbox and/or Google Drive.

Goal 4 is not necessarily related to remark, but is related to marking student
work with external examiners, who are not always willing to use more explicit
version-control systems, such as git.

* Files and Directories

=remark= looks for files ending in =.mrk=.

The suggested filename extension for remark files is =.mrk=, but the file
system structure is otherwise quite flexible.

The basic usage is to have a =.mrk= file per student.

#+BEGIN_SRC
oleks.mrk
oleks-1.mrk
oleks-2.mrk
oleks-3.mrk
oleks/4.mrk
oleks/5.mrk
oleks/6.mrk
#+END_SRC

* Syntax

A =.mrk= file is a list of judgements.

A judgement starts with a header mark (a sequence of `#`), a title (followed by
a `:`), given points (followed by `/`), and maximum points (followed by a line
break). The number of `#` determines the depth of the header, and every file
must start at depth 1, but may have multiple depth 1 judgements. For instance,
a file may contains two depth 1 judgements as follows:

#+BEGIN_SRC
# Theory: 27/50
# Practice: 35/50
#+END_SRC

The header of a judgement may be followed by qualitative remarks. Remarks begin with an indentation
