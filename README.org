When judging student performance, it is useful to have both small, composable,
quantitive judgements, and qualitative remarks. This makes both spreadsheets
and mere text-files ill-suited for marking student work.  Although org-mode can
solve this problem to a great extent, it becomes a heavy tool in the light of
having to mark hundreds of students in a distributed fashion. With org-mode,
everything is in one file, while global, intra-student statistics are not
needed until all the students have been fully marked.

* Design Goals

  1. One human-readable/editable file per student.
  2. Export options to spreadsheet-formats.
  3. git-friendly file format.
  4. Synchronization options with Dropbox and/or Google Drive.

Goal 4 is not necessarily related to MRK, but is related to marking student
work with external examiners, who are not always willing to use more explicit
version-control systems, such as git.
